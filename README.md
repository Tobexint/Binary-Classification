# Summary
In this lesson, we'll continue using PyTorch and build our very first neural network model. We'll use this model to classify if a wildlife camera image shows a hog or not.

## Objectives
- Convert images from grayscale to RGB.
- Resize images.
- Create a transformation pipeline to standardize images for training.
- Build and train a simple neural network model in PyTorch.
- Save our trained neural network to disk.

### New Terms
- Activation function
- Automatic differentiation
- Backpropagation
- Binary classification
- Cross-entropy
- Epoch
- Layers
- Logits
- Optimizer
